This template supports Revit versions 2020 through 2026 and is intended for use with Claude Code.
In order to build your code to Revit 2025 or newer, you must install the .Net 8 SDK.
To do so, go to the following link and download the .Net 8 SDK:
	https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0

The template copies built code to a sub-folder in the Revit Addins folder.
The sub-folder is named after the add-in assembly name and contains the add-in manifest file and the add-in assembly.
The .addin file is automatically updated with the correct path to the add-in assembly.

## Future Improvements

- **Multi-image input** — Allow users to provide multiple reference images (front, side, top, detail) so the AI can generate more accurate 3D geometry for complex objects instead of guessing unseen sides from a single photo
